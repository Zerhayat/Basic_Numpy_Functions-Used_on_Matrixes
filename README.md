# Basic_Numpy_Functions-Used_on_Matrixes
I’m developing expertise in Python and machine learning model training to pursue a career as an ML Engineer.
This Matrix Calculator is a Python program that uses NumPy to perform various matrix operations.
It allows the user to:
Create two matrices (A and B) of custom sizes.
Perform mathematical and statistical operations.
Work interactively via a menu system.

1.Custom Matrix Creation

2.User inputs the number of rows and columns for each matrix.

3.Matrices are auto-filled with sequential numbers.

4.Matrix Operations

5.Addition → A + B

6.Multiplication → A × B using np.dot()

7.Determinant of A and B using np.linalg.det()

8.Transpose of A and B using np.transpose()

9.Statistical Analyzer

10.Mean (np.mean())

11.Median (np.median())

12.Correlation coefficient (np.corrcoef())

13.Error Handling

14.Gracefully handles invalid inputs.

15.Catches exceptions for unsupported operations.

Using numpy made different tasks go one liner and pretty easy to do like matrix multiplication or addition without running a loop. Numpy arrays are awesome.
